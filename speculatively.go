Package speculatively provides a simple mechanism to speculatively execute a
task in parallel only after some initial timeout has elapsed.

This was inspired by the "Defeat your 99th percentile with speculative task"
blog post[1], which describes it nicely:

The speculative tasks implemented here are similar to "hedged requests" as
described in "The Tail at Scale"[2] and implemented in the Query example
function in "Go Concurrency Patterns: Timing out, moving on"[3], but they a)
have no knowledge of different replicas and b) wait for a caller-controlled
timeout before launching additional tasks.
